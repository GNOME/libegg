	* libegg/gtktreemodelfilter.[ch]: merge changes from
	gtk+/gtk/gtktreemodelsort.c HEAD, and get it working again

	* libegg/gtktreemodelfilter.c (gtk_tree_model_filter_row_changed):
	add code to build root level if it isn't there, and set visibility
	to FALSE by default. (We don't let the path conversion func build
	levels, so we special case the root level here). (Pointed out
	by Bastien Nocera and Jorn Baayen).

	* libegg/eggcellrendererkeys.c
	(egg_cell_renderer_keys_start_editing): connect to unrealize and
	remove the key filter, seems to avoid a crash in some cases.

	* eggcellrendererkeys.c: fix some deprecation stuff.
