Highlevel API:
* Add API for showing a page setup dialog
* Add a way to make the cairo printing callbacks (optionally) happen in a thread
* Add API to EggPrintOperation to handle job status feedback while printing.
  Needs something like "job_status_changed" and "job_finished" signals
* Add API to allow the app to add a custom tab with gtk+ widgets to the
  print dialog. We can hopefully implement this on osx & win32.
* Finish all the tables in paper_names.c

Win32:
* Use threads for the dialog, to allow repaints of other windows while they are up
