Highlevel API:
* Add a way to make the cairo printing callbacks (optionally) happen in a thread
* Add API to EggPrintOperation to handle job status feedback while printing.
  Needs something like "job_status_changed" and "job_finished" signals
* Add API to allow the app to add a custom tab with gtk+ widgets to the
  print dialog. We can hopefully implement this on osx & win32.

Lowlevel API:
* Figure out the best way to configure module loading (textfile, gtkrc or 
  just frob the modules directory)
* Make sure to hook up to GtkModule for finding modules when we move to gtk

Cups/Unix:
* Add custom translations for a lot of standard PPD options
* Hook up the settings in the "Job" tab
* Figure out the details in handling page size, orientation and margins
* General UI review and polish
* fix UI padding according to HIG
* Hide tabs if there is no printers (none selected)
* Make print button insensitive if no printer selected

PDF backend:
* Change to using a GtkFileChooserEntry to get file names when we move to 
  GTK.  It is a private object in GTK right now.

Win32:
* Use threads for the dialog, to allow repaints of other windows while they are up

print dialog:
* conflicts with page size...
* Remove page size & orientation from print dialog (is in page setup)
* Add nicer scaling to print dialog (scale to fit page size)
* add printer default option to InputSlot (see mail from m sweet)
* print preview ideas?

<matthias> - should base64 move to glib ?
<matthias> must use themed icons, not xpms
<matthias> I think it would be good to have some overview notes in there somewhere, basically the contents of your email
<matthias> since it can be a bit confusing that there are different layers which can be ported

page setting dialog:
* land/port icons

* sort paper lists
* nicer unit editor than spinbutton
