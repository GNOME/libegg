These functions have been used as the basis for similar 
functionality in GTK+ 2.4:

EggMenuMerge    has become GtkUIManager
EggActionGroup  has become GtkActionGroup
EggAction       has become GtkAction
EggToggleAction has become GtkToggleAction
EggRadioAction  has become GtkRadioAction

The DTD used for XML UI descriptions has been changed a bit, 
see the GtkUIManager chapter in the GTK+ 2.4 API reference.
It also contains a chapter on "Migrating from old menu and 
toolbar systems to GtkAction".
