* support horizontal orientation for other styles but icon only
* consider scrollbar size in size-request
  - is that even possible?
* implement natural-size interface:
  - requires GtkNaturalSize to be pushed to GTK+

* left-align labels (and center icons) in both-horiz mode
* enforce "expand" and "homogeneous" child property
* request rotated rendering of text-only items
* ask tool items to apply ellipses to labels
