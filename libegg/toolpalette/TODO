EggToolPalette
==============

* support horizontal orientation for other styles but icon only:
  - GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS: done
  - GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT: rotate the text labels. currently can be done
    by poking into the tool items internal's. would be better if
    GtkToolShell would announce the required text orientation.
  - GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH: place items similar to Nautilus' icon view.
  - GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH_HORIZ: place items similar to Nautilus' compact view.
    guess it's only in trunk. Manny blogged about it. Don't know right now
    how the Windows Explorer calls that view.
* left-align labels (and center icons) in both-horiz mode:
  - would require poking into the tool item right now. would be better
    if GtkToolShell would announce the required text alignment.
* apply ellipses to text item labels:
  - would require poking into the tool item right now. would be better
    if GtkToolShell would announce the preferred ellipsize mode.
* consider scrollbar size in size-request
  - is that even possible?
* implement natural-size interface:
  - requires GtkNaturalSize to be pushed to GTK+

GtkToolShell/GtkToolItem
========================

* enforce "expand" and "homogeneous" child property. don't know if GObject can
  enforce implementation of child properties.
* inform tool items about the desired text orientation, alignment and ellipsize
  mode by implementing gtk_tool_shell_get_text_orientation(),
  gtk_tool_shell_get_text_alignment() and gtk_tool_shell_get_ellipsize_mode().
  change GtkToolItem to use that information.
