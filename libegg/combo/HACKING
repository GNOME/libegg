A new ComboBox framework for GTK+
--------------------------------
Official development area!!!


NOTE: this code REQUIRES patching of gtk+, patches are included:
- table-menu-patch

NOTE (2): please do not commit anything here without my permission. (where
'my' is kris).


my todolist
-----------

* positing code needs to get the menu under the mouse cursor such that
the active item is under the mouse cursor. Still following me? (:

General stuff:
* drag selection in treeview
* egg_cell_view_set_values really needs to work like gtk_tree_model_set. It
  confuses the hell out of my right now. (-- still needed?)
* what to do if the combo box item list is being cleared? (wrt to sample)

Completion:
 - figure out if we need async data sources, and if so think about a nice
   API. (load-on-demand? call some given function if the contents of the
   entry changed? update func? invalidation?)
 - configurable completion delay? (this may be bloat)
 - need something for the TAB key?
 - you should be able to move through the popup with the arrow keys, we
   prolly need treeview modes for this, or some hackish code.
