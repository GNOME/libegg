A new ComboBox framework for GTK+
--------------------------------
Official development area!!!


NOTE: this code REQUIRES patching of gtk+, patches are included:
- table-menu-patch
- entry-arrow-hack

NOTE (2): please do not commit anything here without my permission. (where
my is kris).


my todolist
-----------

New:
- finish positioning code
- might want to move shared code to GtkBin

General stuff:
* drag selection in treeview
* egg_cell_view_set_values really needs to work like gtk_tree_model_set. It
  confuses the hell out of my right now.
* what to do if the combo box item list is being cleared? (wrt to sample)
* use "combo_box" instead of "combobox"
* need headers with copyright etc (DOH)

Completion:
 - figure out if we need async data sources, and if so think about a nice
   API. (load-on-demand? call some given function if the contents of the
   entry changed? update func? invalidation?)
 - configurable completion delay? (this may be bloat)
 - need something for the TAB key?
 - you should be able to move through the popup with the arrow keys, we
   prolly need treeview modes for this, or some hackish code.
