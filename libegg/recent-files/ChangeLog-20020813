	* gnome-vfs-module/*:  New stuff, pathetic attempt at making a
	gnome-vfs module that displays the recent list.

	* test/populate-recent.c:  Removed the gtk stuff, as that is no longer
	needed.

08-12-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-model.c:  Put some timeout stuff in to "buffer" the
	change events from FAM.

08-10-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-model.[ch]
	(gnome_recent_model_set_filter_uri_schemes):  New function, lets you
	filter the list based on a URI scheme (http, ftp, file, etc)

	Reinstated monitoring of files in the list.  It is still "leaky", but
	it is not really harmful.

	Switched back to gnome-vfs monitoring for notification.  This seems to
	be the best way to accomplish this, regardless of its crappiness.

08-10-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-model.c:  Changed the API of the constructor a bit.

	* test/populate-recent.c:  Modified to let you add/delete a given
	URI, as well as recursively add ones in a directory.

08-10-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-model.c:  Fix a crappy locking problem.

	* src/gnome-recent-view-*.c:  Fix some mem leaks, and other brokeness

	* test/gtk-view-test.c:  Cleanup

08-10-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-model.c:  Implemented a notification mechanism
	that uses a property on the root window.

	* TODO:  Updated

	* Other cleanups in the views, sample programs, etc.

08-08-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* README:  Updated.

	* TODO:  Updated.

	* src/gnome-recent-model.[ch]:  Changed from flat-file storage
	mechanism to an XML based one.  Added a bunch of API to allow
	filtering based on either mime-type, or "groups". 

	* src/gnome-recent-item.[ch]:  Instead of passing string URIs around,
	we pass GnomeRecentItems around, which contain all sorts of metadata.
	
	* src/gnome-recent-storge.[ch]:  Removed.

	* test/populate-recent.c:  Useful program that allows you to easily
	put a bunch of stuff in gnome-recent by passing it a directory and
	a level of recursion.  Doing something like "populate-recent / 5"
	will insert a shload of stuff.

	* test/*view-test.c:  Updated these to take advantage of the new
	features.

07-11-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* src/gnome-recent-storage.[ch]:  New files, provides initial
	implementation of a proposed recent file storage specification.

	* src/gnome-recent-model.[ch]:  Added a "changed" method to trigger
	a sort of fake notification.  It is used to initially populate views.
	Also, converted to new storage mechanism (gnome-recent-storage).

	* src/gnome-recent-*.c:  Added finalize handlers to all the
	GObjects.

07-02-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* some more minor cleanup
	* (src/gnome-recent-view.c):  Removed the "clear" function from the
	interface.  It is not needed.

06-25-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* more cleanup in gnome-recent-model.c

04-29-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* general cleanup, and made the "changed" signal in gnome-recent-model
	return boolean, so we know if the app was able to open the file or
	not.

03-23-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* switched to use autotools for building
	* converted to a model-view architecture.  There is one model, and two
	views.  One that uses GTK+, and one that uses BonoboUI.  Really not
	much code added, just a lot moved around.


02-04-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* gnome-recent.[ch]  (gnome_recent_new*): Converted to use
	construct properties.  GnomeRecent should be ok for language
	bindings now.

01-30-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* gnome-recent.[ch]:  (gnome_recent_get_limit): New functions

01-30-2002  James Willcox  <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* gnome-recent.[ch]:  Backed out the changes needed for bonoboui
	and made a new GObject instead.  It was such a kludge to have
	them both in the same object.


01-15-2002  James Willcox <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>
	
	* gnome-recent.[ch]:  Shloads of changes to support bonoboui.
	Probably lots more bugs too.  Lots of cleaning up to do.

	* gnome-recent-bonoboui-test.c: New file, basically a complete rip-off
	of the hello.c in bonoboui.  Demonstrates the new bonoboui API
	for gnome-recent.


12-09-2001  James Willcox <jwillcox@cs.indiana.edu>

	* Initial import of this file.
