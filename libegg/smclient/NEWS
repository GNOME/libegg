	* Various bugfixes and leak fixes

	* The osx backend works now, and the win32 backend no longer
          requires a call to g_thread_init().

	* There is now a D-Bus backend that uses the gnome-session
          2.24 D-Bus API. See the notes at the end of README. Although
          the Makefiles in this directory do not support it, it would
          be possible to build libeggsmclient with support for D-Bus
          and not XSMP.

	* EggLauncher is now replaced by EggDesktopFile

	* egg_sm_client_register() is now gone, replaced by
          egg_set_desktop_file() and egg_sm_client_set_mode(). See the
          beginning of the "Using EggSMClient" section of README for
          details of how these work.

	* The state-saving machinery has changed; it's all based on
          keyfiles now. See the "More notes" section of README for an
          explanation of why this is cool.

	* egg_sm_client_end_session() no longer takes an EggSMClient;
          eventually it could be put somewhere entirely
          non-EggSMClient-related in the public API.

	* The win32 backend works now.
