	* egglauncher.c: New, replaces EggDesktopFile (as a replacement
	for GnomeDesktopItem...)

	* eggdesktopfile.c: gone

	* egg-launch.c: test program

	* eggsmclient-xsmp.c (set_restart_properties): use EggLauncher

	* eggsmclient-win32.c: Make this compile and at least partially
	work (quit_requested doesn't work and probably needs to be
	rewritten using a second thread as suggested in the comments in
	will_quit()). Patch from Yevgen Muntyan, #399315.

	* eggsmclient-xsmp.c: Use gdk_threads_enter/_leave around gtk
	calls and EggSMClient signal emissions. Based on a patch from
	Yevgen Muntyan.

	* Makefile.am:
	* eggsmclient.c (egg_sm_client_get): Change the #defines from
	HAVE_XSMP and HAVE_DBUS to EGG_SM_CLIENT_BACKEND_XSMP and
	EGG_SM_CLIENT_BACKEND_DBUS, to avoid being tricked by the app
	having its own HAVE_DBUS define. Needs to be fixed better though.
	Also change the win32 check from G_OS_WIN32 to
	GDK_WINDOWING_WIN32, since it assumes the win32 gdk backend.

	* logout-test.c: New test program to test logout
	notification/cancellation support (and demonstrate that it doesn't
	really work on Windows).

	* README: add more GnomeClient porting notes based on an email
	exchange with Jani Monoses
